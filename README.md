# Welcome to Fyt!! ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Clone the Repo!
If you already are familiar with React-Native, just clone the repo below and get started!

```bash
https://github.com/Billieve13/Fyt.git
```

## Get started
1. Install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   ```bash
   VS Code Extension Recommendations:
      - React-Native Tools
      - Expo Tools
   ```

2. Install Mobile Expo Client
   ```bash
   Download Expo Client on your phone
   ```
    
3. Open your command line prompt, preferrably bash
   ```bash
   Create a project folder - Fyt (mkdir Fyt)
   ```
   
   ```bash
   change directories to the Fyt folder (cd Fyt)
   ```
   
4. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   Ensure you are running at least version 12 of Node (Node -v / Node -version)
   ```
      
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo -CLI
   ```

5. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start (use --tunnel if you have issues initially connecting the app to Expo Client on your phone)
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
